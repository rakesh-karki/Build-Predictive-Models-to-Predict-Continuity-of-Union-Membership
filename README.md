# Build Predictive Models to Predict Continuity of Union Membership
In this project, I will use a hypothetical trade union (UDSU) data to build predictive models that can predict whether a person will remain in the union or not.       
The "UDSU_train.csv" table will be used to train, test and validate the models while "UDSU_toPredict.csv" has the information of potential member to be evaluated for continuity of union membership. 

**The tables contains the following variables:**    
- **DS_ID:** member ID number  
- **gender:** member gender  
- **management:** if the member holds management position  
- **USACitizen:** if the member is a USA citizen  
- **Married:** if the member is married  
- **MonthsInUnion:** how many months the member has been a Union member  
- **ContinuingEd:** if the member is continuing education  
- **Feature A, B, C, D, E, F:** fictitious features  
- **Connectivity:** member's internet connectivity  
- **DuesFrequency:** union fees pay frequency  
- **PaperlessBill:** if the member receives paperless bill  
- **PaymentMethod:** method of union due payment  
- **MonthlyDue:** monthly membership due   
- **TotalDues:** total outstanding due  
- **LeftUnion:** still a union member; or no longer a member (label)
